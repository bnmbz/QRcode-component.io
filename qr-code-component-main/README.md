## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned some CSS styles. Like how to aling center without using the text align property.

```html
<body>
  <h1 class="content">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
</body>
```
```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
Another way of doing this:
```css
h1{
  width: 50vw;
  margin: auto 50%;
}
```
And I also learned some Media Quary:
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 375px) {
  h1{
    float: right;
    color: blue;
    font-size: 1.25rem;
    /*And lastly I learned how to change the display of a block element.*/
    display: inline;
  }
}
```





### Continued development
I will like to solave many challenges on Media Quary and still keep learnig the responsive designs.



### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtub.com/freecodecamp) - This helped me when I was strugling whith the responsive design and margins. I really liked free code camp and will use it going forward.
